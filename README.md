ArgusCore üëÅÔ∏èA Real-Time Object Recognition App for iOSArgusCore is a powerful iOS application that uses on-device machine learning to identify objects in real-time through the camera. By leveraging Apple's native frameworks, all processing happens locally, ensuring instantaneous results, complete offline functionality, and absolute user privacy.Core TechnologiesSwift & UIKit: For the native application logic and user interface.Core ML: To run the MobileNetV2 machine learning model directly on the device.Vision Framework: To prepare camera frames for analysis by the Core ML model.AVFoundation: To capture and process the live video feed from the iPhone's camera.How It WorksThe app follows a simple, efficient pipeline for real-time analysis:Capture: The AVFoundation framework captures live video from the camera.Prepare: For each video frame, the Vision framework prepares the image for the model.Analyze: The prepared image is sent to the Core ML model (MobileNetV2) for classification.Display: The top classification results are displayed on the UI, updating in real-time.Key FeaturesReal-Time Classification: Identifies objects on a frame-by-frame basis.On-Device Processing: All processing happens locally. No data is sent to the cloud.Privacy-Focused: The app only requires camera access and does not store or transmit any user data.Offline Capable: Works perfectly without an internet connection.Setup InstructionsTo run this project:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/omgupta-ai/ArgusCore-IOS-Classifier.git](https://github.com/omgupta-ai/ArgusCore-IOS-Classifier.git)
Open the project in Xcode.Download the Core ML Model:Download MobileNetV2.mlmodel from Apple's Developer Website.Drag the downloaded .mlmodel file into the Xcode project navigator.Run the app:Select an iOS Simulator or a physical device and click Run (‚ñ∂Ô∏è).AuthorOm Manoj GuptaLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/om-manoj-gupta-428110202GitHub: github.com/omgupta-aiLicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
