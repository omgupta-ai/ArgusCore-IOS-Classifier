ArgusCore 👁️
Real-Time Object Recognition Engine for iOS
ArgusCore is a lightweight, powerful iOS application that uses on-device machine learning to identify objects in real-time through the camera. By leveraging Apple's native frameworks, all processing happens locally, ensuring instantaneous results, complete offline functionality, and absolute user privacy.

✨ Core Technologies
This project was built using a modern, native iOS tech stack:

Swift & UIKit: For the core application logic and native user interface.

Core ML: To integrate and run the MobileNetV2 machine learning model directly on the device.

Vision Framework: To manage the image processing pipeline, preparing camera frames for analysis by the Core ML model.

AVFoundation: To capture and process the live video feed from the iPhone's camera.

🧠 Architectural Flow
The application follows a streamlined, efficient data pipeline from camera input to UI output. Each frame from the camera is processed in real-time through a series of steps managed by the ViewController.

🌟 Key Features
Real-Time Classification: Identifies objects in the camera's view on a frame-by-frame basis.

On-Device Processing: All machine learning inference happens locally. No data is sent to the cloud.

Privacy-Focused: The app only requires camera access and does not store or transmit any user data.

Offline Capable: Works perfectly without an internet connection.

Efficient Performance: Optimized to run smoothly, leveraging hardware acceleration through Apple's frameworks.

🛠️ Setup & Installation
To run this project yourself:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/omgupta-ai/ArgusCore-IOS-Classifier.git](https://github.com/omgupta-ai/ArgusCore-IOS-Classifier.git)

Open the project in Xcode:
Navigate to the cloned directory and open the ArgusCore.xcodeproj file.

Download the Model:
The project uses MobileNetV2.mlmodel. You can download it directly from Apple's Developer Website and drag it into the Xcode project navigator.

Run the app:
Select a simulator or a physical device and press the "Run" button (▶️). The app will ask for camera permissions, which must be granted.
